SplitControllerAndCustomNavigation
==================
This is a sample XCode project that shows how to create custom split controller (similar to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#DOCUMENTATION/UIKit/Reference/UISplitViewController_class/Reference/Reference.html">UISplitViewController</a>), which works on both iPhone and iPad. This split view controller works in both landscape and portrait orientations. In addition, it shows you how to create custom tab-bar controller for organizing your controllers, which also works in multiple organizations.

Finally, it comes with a customizer controller that allows users to re-order the tabs based on their likings.

(Note that iPad images are stretched to show that they are horizontal and vertical scrollable)
